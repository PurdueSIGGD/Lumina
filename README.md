Welcome!

Lumina is the new SIGGD game determined for 2017. It is planned to be a first person fantasy dungeon crawling game, fine tuned to challenge the player as much as possible with adaptive AI and multiple gameplay challenges. 

The [creators and maintainers](/docs/GameCredits.md) are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians. We encourage others to join!

We encourage contributions from anybody and try to keep a warm and friendly community.

## Playing

We have a build that is working right now. [download build](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0hZRv8pG5b3R21sVFI5bWF3d1E)
The game has basic mechanics and GUI (graphical user interface) down.

Note: to go into dungeon, go to one of the wells, press 'f'

## Developing

We mostly use Unity 2017.1 as the main game framework, [download it here](https://unity3d.com/). We also use various graphics tools like Blender, Maya and audio tools.
